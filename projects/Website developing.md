My family owns this milk tea business in both Florida and Hawaii named Shaka Shaka, as part of the family, I had to help on the website designed and arranged all the information for the business back when I was in High School.

From this project, I learned how websites works in coding, and it helps me realized behind the pretty pictures and outlets in a webiste are just many coding process, and website developing is not as easy as what I excepted. But this project really hooked me up into my current computer science path.
