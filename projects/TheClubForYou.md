### Overview
The Club for You is a project website me and my team developed in my 2021 fall semester.

Inside the web page, there will be explaination of each clubs and the detail informations related to that club, students are also allow to filter out their interest type of clubs.

### Contribution
My duties in this project was to set up the "Sign up" page and "Register" page for users to create an account in our webiste database. And I added a "Faviorite" button under each clubs, so users will be able to store some of their faviorite clubs in another collection. Most importantly, I was arranging the team to working on each sections, and set up group meeting and doing all other tasks as a team leader.
	
### Learning
During the process of this project, my team and I have discussed and solved many functional programming problems that helps the site works better
