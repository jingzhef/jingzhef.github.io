Coding is one of the fundamental requirements for Computer Science developers, it has provided thousands and millions of possibilities of combination in one project, but It also encountered hundreds and thousands of problem errors while creating. To me, coding is like doing a scientific experiment that requires observation, question, research, hypothesis, experiment, and conclusions. Because the basic process of start coding is to observe the problem and create a strategy in the algorithm, then we have to apply such algorithms to our hypothesis in code from and iterate it to confront the result of this experiment solved the problem in the hypothesis, we called this the "Design Patterns" in computer science. The existence of design patterns is to keep the software development as maintainable and extensible as possible to reduce the coupling of the code in one project.
