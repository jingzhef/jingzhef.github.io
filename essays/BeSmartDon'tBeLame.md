According to “How to ask questions the smart way” by Eric Raymond, the elite programmers only like what’s challenging, creative, and the questions that can make them evaluate themselves. Asking a smart question with a specific and super-concise problem description will be taken as a stimulus or a gift to responders because it’s an effective way to have a better understanding and learning programming. Asking questions that are lame and boring, or where you could google the answer tends to piss off the elite programmers like hackers because you are wasting time on both of you and them.

Here are two examples of “Smart question” and “not smart question”

## Smart Way
[Something better than many nested `for` loops?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69089153/something-better-than-many-nested-for-loops)
In this question, the author asked for a better understanding of how to make a neater “for” loop function for his game. I found this is a smart way to ask the question because the answers can vary, the responses can be competing with each other on whose codes end up working faster and better, and this is the type of questions for unskilled people like me would want to browser and check to improve the ability on using “for” loop for my software engineering path.




## Not Smart Way
[“ What is the difference between constructor "=default" and the compiler-generated constructor in C++? ”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68821529/what-is-the-difference-between-constructor-default-and-the-compiler-generated)
This question is one of the top questions from StackOverFlow, the author asked the difference between a default constructor and a compiler-generated constructor in C++. I found this question boring and not smart because this is the type of question where we can find the answers from researching and collecting information from different sources. And I’m positive that none of the experts would want to waste their time on doing Google’s duties and answer all the differences between them.
