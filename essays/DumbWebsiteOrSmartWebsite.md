Many kids probably wondered how did all the research, gaming, or shopping pages on Google were created when they first get in touch with computers, I was one of them, and web development is actually one of the reasons that attracted me and made me wanted to become to a computer science student. After weeks of studying HTML and CSS and Semantic UI, I have learned many different things to create a nice outlooking and useful website by using features such as “icon”, “classes”, “div”, and “styles”. Recently, we have been working on many projects using those frameworks, at first, I failed a couple of the practice assignments which was frustrating and stressed me out, I was concerned about the difficulty of UI framework is going to be another level, until semantic UI shows up and saved my life. After reviewing all the structures in semantic UI, I have done many practices during my free time, and those hard works paid off, even I was surprised to myself after finishing the web page within the required time and done all other setting requirements nicely, it was at that point, I failed in love with this programming language.


Having many programming language studied at the same time is not easy. After started the journey with the UI framework, I noticed that semantic UI are way easier than raw HTML and CSS structure, Semantic UI to me is an updated version and combination of HTML and CSS where it organized the web page and ensure that my designs look stunning and bundle a range of components and settings by simply apply few semantic methods into the class section, plus I can still use all the technics I learned from my past coding experiences while creating a project with Semantic UI because many of the frameworks required javascript to help run the web application, for example, the dropdown button in semantic UI requires a javascript function in order to have to button works. As a software engineer, it's nice to have a field where I can practice both my of programming languages skills, and now I can’t find a way to reject such a convenient tool in my web developing career.
