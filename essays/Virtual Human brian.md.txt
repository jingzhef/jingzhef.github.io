	Programming languages is one of the most successful creatures humans have ever made. With that said, it is also one of the hardest projects for us to learn, but it does evaluate my knowledge to the next level when I realize how many surprises it brought to us. Javascript is one of my currents focuses in coding structure, at first it looks just like an improved version of Java, I changed my mind right after it impressed me with all its useful and convenient features better than Java or other programming languages I’ve learned. I don't get as advanced in coding as I did in other fields, but from what I have learned about javascript so far, I feel pretty confident about building more codes or projects with it and be ready to take more advantage of it to prepare for my future career.
	My first reaction to athletic software engineering is how could someone put two unrelated existences together without feeling weird and build upon them, well, Javascript did. And that’s where I like about programming because it is always exploring new creatures where nobody has ever imagined, and later on those ideas will become a trend in the modern world and more and more ideas like that will be created. After my first attempt at the practice “Work of the day“, I found myself surprised at how I was able to solve the problem without external sources, and found the practice WOD useful because it delivered an idea of how Javascript looks and works which settle my stress heart down while thinking about the official upcoming WOD. One part I love about our current learning style is that everyone is getting one partner while doing the WODs to discuss and share opinions in their own will, this relaxes me while coding on some difficult projects, and I don’t have to worry about getting stuck with no clue where the next step is and zone out for the rest of the period. I do believe that to create the best code in the world, that requires many peers to review it and discuss it, coding is never only about one person’s interlligence, it has been so successful because it absorbed many other’s ideas too, and that’s what we are using and leading me to success.
