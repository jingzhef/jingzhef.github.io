## Inspiration

Software Engineering has been a strange word to me until I got involved in developing my first website for my family business. I was obsessed with computer games when I was a kid, I played all different kinds of games like RPG, FPS, etc. Sometimes I wonder what kind of genius created such brilliant ideas for us to have a joyful childhood, ten years later I find out they are called programmers. When I was in high school, I had to move to Florida with my family to start a business there, and I was the only one interested in all the modern technologies which caused me became the one who was in charge and controls all the social media and online platforms for the business, and that's where I started understanding what's behind all the nice picture and information for a website are uncountable codes.

## Possibilities

I started learning about coding while I was in High School, it didn't start well as I expected it would, It was much tougher and complicated than any other language I ever learned, but I didn't quit studying it until today because I discovered many possibilities of what coding can achieve and us human could not, and this is part of the reason why I decided to choose this software engineering as my future career path.

## Way to wealthy

I have done many kinds of research in high school when building ideas for future careers, the first object that caught my attention was software engineering, where it was considered as one of the well-paying jobs. At that moment, this title has accomplished two of my life goals: become wealthy and use coding to create something others didn't. So I have been working on it since my learned the fact of this is what I been chasing for, and I do want learn more contents from all ICS related classes to enriches my coding skills to prepare for my future works or projects in the computer science field.
