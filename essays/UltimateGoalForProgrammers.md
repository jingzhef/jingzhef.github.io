If there is one coding standard or software engineering technique that is suitable for all programming languages, that will be the most exciting thing to see and the ultimate goal for all programmers to achieve. 
After a week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, I'm impressed by this software and the technologies inside of it, tons of useful features included inspections, code styles, and other tools helping me with coding in all programming languages. I used to work on codes with JGrasp, a software tool I was required to use in my early programming path, and the only advantage I could hear from people about jGrasp is that it's free to use. I think a professional or more advanced coding software like IntelliJ will boost the progress of building new projects because the software will remind you of what you missing and suggest a more convenient way while coding. 

ESLint is one of the best performance inspection tools I have ever seen so far in my software engineer career, it has saved many of my messy and untidy projects with its warning sign and error signs when I didn't even realize such errors exists. My goal on each of my projects is to achieve the green checkmark on ESLint, I found it's useful because it's helping me to complete my projects to a perfect version with understandable concepts and correct coding styles, this is important in the technical field especially in coding what requires precise data and even one small mistake can cause exception in the program, with the inspection from ESLint, it prevents the project from crushing due to coding style errors while running the same code in different software tools.

As the developments of software are fast forward, I believe in a short time, we will create a better developing software tool for all programmers in all different languages and fields.
