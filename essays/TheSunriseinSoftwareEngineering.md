In the past couple of months, I have experienced uncountable nights struggling with the algorithms of how can I make my web page functioning correctly and how can I pass this course with a good grade, and this has finally come to an end. During the learning process in this class, I found the essence of software engineering includes much more than just web developments, concepts like configuration management, functional programming, development environment, and user interface frameworks are really helping this industry gets better. 

While working on a few of the assignments from this class, I noticed that every piece of information from different files that related to the concepts mentioned above are an indispensable part of the final outcome. Configuration helps to build connections between different organizations in the software, functional programming determines the working complexity of the software, and the development environment can vary due to different requirements of project types, and the combination of those beautiful creatures has brought me many different possibilities in my software engineering career. Ethics in software engineering was a lesson that revealed the “Association for Computing Machinery” code of ethics to me and teaches me about my responsibilities on working in the software engineering industry.

At the end of the semester, I realize software engineering is never a one-person task, with a great team backing me up, I felt much more confident about solving encountered problems during the progress of my projects, the team is a really important matter in software engineering or any other fields and that is something I truly experienced from the final project, without the contributions from my team, I would not able to create such beautiful project on my own.

Overall, the adventure in my ICS 314 course was meaningful and delightful to me as an ICS major student who failed a few of the WODs at the beginning of this semester but end up earning all the points back and finish this course with the desired grade. I appreciate all the opportunities and help I received from this class and I’m certain the knowledge I learned will pave the way for me in my future software engineering career.
