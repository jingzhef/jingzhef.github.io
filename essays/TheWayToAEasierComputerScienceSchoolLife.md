In my software engineer career, sometimes it’s really nice to have a guideline or tutor that can help me while I’m getting stuck on my direction for the future, the existence of RadGrad became a tool in my current college life and I’m impressed by this new organizer specifically for Hawaii local computer science students after having a tour with it. I discovered many new interesting computer science-related paths in RadGrad and just realized there are so many opportunities for students like us happening on this small Island. It feels like there are many different subtrees under the computer science root, and RadGrad is the algorithms that specify the value inside different nodes, which acknowledged me with many new pieces of information about computer science.

A great tool can help me clarify and organize my mind and plans. I think RadGrad is a great website and fulfilled the desires of both local software engineers and students studying computer science in Hawaii. The best part I liked about RadGrad is it shows what’s the best matching or closest classes based on the interests I selected, then it allows me to arrange those classes in the different academic years so I can plan for the rest of my school years in advance.

All my friends used to recommend that I seek a professional and legit job in the mainland where has tons of opportunities for software engineering. But after browsing so many opportunities and planned the rest of my educational life on RadGrad, I started to put hopes on achieving the highest computer science level I can then get hired by one of the enterprises in Hawaii.
